
This solves the 3D matching problem

It contains a randomized and brute force solution
I did not implement the GA solution

The 3 sets can be modified in problem.java

NOTE: 
Due to combinatorical explosion I would not reccomend making the sets larger 
than a length of 3. 

3^3 = 27 and for a combo of len 3 this is over 2900 arrays of combinations to store


TO RUN THE PROGRAM:

simply run javac *.java
and Either
java RandomizedSol
or
java BruteForceSol
